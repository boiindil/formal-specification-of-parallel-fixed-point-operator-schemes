abstract: >
  This repository provides a formal, domain-agnostic specification of a class
  of massively parallel fixed-point operator schemes. The document focuses on
  mathematical structure and algorithmic abstraction rather than implementation,
  optimization, or application. It is intended as a reference artifact for
  research in parallel algorithms, high-performance computing, and theoretical
  computer science.
