# Abstract HPC Fixed-Point Algorithm Specification

This repository contains a **formal, domain-agnostic specification**
of a class of massively parallel fixed-point algorithms.

## What this is

- A mathematical and structural description of an algorithmic class
- A reference artifact for theoretical and architectural discussion
- A non-executable, non-optimized, non-applied specification

## What this is NOT

- Not a software library
- Not an implementation
- Not a solver
- Not a benchmark
- Not an application framework

## Intended Audience

- Researchers in parallel algorithms
- HPC and supercomputing architects
- Theoretical computer scientists
- Applied mathematicians

## Design Principles

- Abstraction over execution
- Structure over optimization
- Safety over applicability
- Clarity over completeness
